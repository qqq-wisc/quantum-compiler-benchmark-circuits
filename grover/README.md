These circuits solve a SAT encoding of the pigeonhole problem using Grover's algorithm.
See [here](https://user.it.uu.se/~tjawe125/software/pigeonhole/) for more information about the SAT encoding
as well as CNF files for bigger instances of the problem.

[gen_grover.py](gen_grover.py) is a script for generating these circuits.
