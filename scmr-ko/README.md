SCMR-KO is a benchmark for the surface code mapping and routing (SCMR) problem.
These circuits, in a similar vein to QUEKO, have a known optimal execution time equal to
the depth of the circuit.

See section 7 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18042.pdf for details.

[gen_ko.py](gen_ko.py) is a script for generating these circuits.
