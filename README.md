# Quantum Compiler Benchmark Circuits
This repository contains benchmark quantum circuits for evaluating our compilers.
Each circuit class has its own directory with a README.md documenting what it is and where it was sourced from.
Some also come with the script used to generate them.


TODO @abtin 
- add msd circuits + info on where they came from. ideally also the script you used to get the QASM

TODO @amanda
- add quarl benchmarks

TODO:
- review + clean up scripts
- add gate set information?
- perhaps add a canonical qiskit decomposition script

## Dependencies
- Python
- TODO: pip freeze

## Resources for Benchmarks
