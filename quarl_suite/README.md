These circuits are new benchmarks added by [Quarl](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10120.pdf).
Some of these algorithms appear in their own directories but for recordkeeping they live here.
Combined with [arithmetic](../arithmetic) and [mctoffoli](../mctoffoli), these circuits make up the entire suite from the paper.
