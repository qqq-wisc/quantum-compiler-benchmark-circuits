Benchmark suite from https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04722.

"several functions taken from RevLib [36] as well as quantum algorithms written in Quipper [24] or the Scaffold language [23] (and pre-compiled by the ScaffoldCC compiler [30]) have been considered"

"Besides that, benchmarks that
are relevant for existing quantum algorithms such as quantum
ripple-carry adders (based on the realization proposed in [37]
and denoted adder) and small versions of Shorâ€™s algorithm
(based on the realization proposed in [38] and denoted shor)
have been considered"
